Everyone knows that modern technology is rapidly opening new experimental possibilities. It has also (to some extent) changed how science is published and communicated, both to the general public ("outreach") and to colleagues and students ("inreach").

In my experience, cyber-tools for inreach have been leveraged very effectively by the statistics, computer science, and machine learning communities. I have benefitted immensely from many (free) online courses, textbooks, and blogs in these areas.

Theoretical neuroscience is getting better. We have a few nice online classes ([here](https://www.coursera.org/course/compneuro), [here](https://www.edx.org/course/neuronal-dynamics-computational-epflx-bio465-1x), and [here](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuraldata)) and an open-access online textbook, [*Neuronal Dynamics (Gerstner et al.)*](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/). 

But I the neuroscience blogosphere is lacking. Blogs are useful for explaining concepts/techniques that fall through the cracks in textbooks, and for highlighting/discussing/debating recent papers and ideas in the field. Some very prominent mathematicians and statisticians maintain blogs for these purposes:

* [Terrence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)
* [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/)
* [Lior Pachter](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/)
	* Made famous for his heated debate with Manolis Kellis, links [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis/), [here](https://liorpachter.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/response_to_nonsense_blog_post.pdf), and [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/number-deconvolution/).

There are [good](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/#.VWi9dK0Viko) [blogs](http://neuwritesd.org/) [about](http://www.wiringthebrain.com/) [neuroscience](http://neurocritic.blogspot.it/) out there. But many of them are written for a lay audience, and very few have a strong computational perspective. I personally like Adam Calhoun's [*Neuroecology*](https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/) and [Jonathan Pillow's lab blog](https://pillowlab.wordpress.com/). Incidentally, Adam would be the first to agree that [the neuroscience blogosphere sucks](https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/2013/10/14/why-is-there-no-neuroscience-blogosphere/).

The purpose of this blog is to encourage the computational neuroscience community to engage more frequently and informally online. In this spirit, it is a *community blog*, accepting posts from anyone interested in contributing material. Here are some reasons you might consider writing a post:

* Give a plug for a recently published paper
* Advertize an upcoming conference or event
* Give a tutorial on a data analysis toolkit
* Highlight under-appreciated techniques and ideas in the field

Stay tuned! More to come soon.
