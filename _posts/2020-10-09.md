<hr>

These notes provide a brief introduction to [optimal transport theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)), prioritizing intuition over mathematical rigor. A short and self-contained Python function that computes the [Wasserstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric) between two discrete distributions is provided. This demo function shows how to solve a [linear program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) using the [`scipy.optimize`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) library.
