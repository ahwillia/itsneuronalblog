Okay, saying that all nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques ***suck*** might be a little harsh, but I'm not above using clickbait to get people to read my blog, and I've got strong feelings about this alright!{% include footnote.html n=1 %}

### Background

### Determining number of clusters

* I suspect that you can come up with synthetic datasets where tSNE gives misleading intuition about the number of clusters

#### Footnotes

{% include foot_bottom.html n=1 %} ***Disclaimer:*** There's something about starting a blog that makes you want to [stir up trouble](#) and [call people out](#) (which can be [a good thing!](#)). I want to make a few things clear. When I first read the [tSNE paper](#) a few years ago, I *thoroughly enjoyed it!* And I think that the research on nonlinear dimensionality reduction has been and continues to be worthwhile. I wrote this only to encourage healthy debate about the pros and cons of this work, and to proven wrong by someone more knowledgeable than me on these topics.
