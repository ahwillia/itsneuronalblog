I've been searching for a good way to organize my thoughts/research interests for the past couple of years. This website/blog has gone through a few iterations as a result, but I feel like I've finally converged on something that works and is manageable for me to maintain.

I will update this post periodically as my research evolves and my interests shift. For now, I plan to be writing quick posts roughly once a month on a few different subjects/categories. For now, here is an outline:

Tutorials: 
----------
* FORCE learning
* Independent Components Analysis

Small stuff that I'm working on:
--------------------------------
* Optimization and Matrix Factorization Tools in Julia

Stuff I want to publish soon:
-----------------------------
* Models of mRNA and protein transport in dendrites
* Clustering algorithms and factor analysis of DNA methylation patterns (and other epigenetic datasets)
