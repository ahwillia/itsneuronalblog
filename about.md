This website was created and is maintained by [Alex Williams](http://alexhwilliams.info). In broad strokes, my goal is to provide open-access learning and reference materials for subjects in quantitative biology and neuroscience.

**The Blog.** I am hoping to have posts roughly twice a month on current trends in computational/theoretical neuroscience. I'm working to corral some other people to contribute a substantial number of these posts. Email or <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsNeuronal" target="_blank">tweet at me</a> if you are interested.

**Online Texts.** I've *started* writing an open-access online textbook on neural modeling. This is a side project that will grow only incrementally over the years, but will hopefully be helpful to some even in its incomplete form. The link is on the menu bar to the left.

If you find errors, or have suggestions about how to improve the content on this website please email me:
