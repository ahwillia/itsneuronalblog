<p>What are some examples of these useful extensions? Sometimes we have data that is quite naturally expressed as a 3D table rather than a matrix. Suppose we measure mRNA expression across the development of an animal. Then at each developmental timepoint we have a $n \times p$ matrix of data as described above. These matrices can be stacked into a 3D data structure, which we call a <strong><em>tensor</em></strong> (specifically, in this case, a third-order tensor). A number of questions arise: Can we apply PCA to this 3D table of data? Are there advantages of expressing the data as a tensor, rather than a matrix? This is the flavor of topics I want to blog about in the next few posts.</p>

<p>This sets the stage for the next post on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_rank_decomposition"><strong>CP Tensor Decomposition</strong></a> (which is one way of generalizing PCA to tensors):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Represent the data as a 3D (or higher!) array of data $A$</li>
  <li>We define a cost function / regularization</li>
  <li>We optimize three small matrices whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product#Tensor_multiplication">tensor product</a> reconstructs the data as best as possible.</li>
  <li>The optimization problem is triconvex. We can still use <a href="http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures/seq_slides.pdf">sequential convex programming</a> methods!</li>
</ul>
