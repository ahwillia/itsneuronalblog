def demo_wasserstein(x, p, q):
    """
    Computes order-2 Wasserstein distance between two
    discrete distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, has shape (num_bins, dimension)
    
        Locations of discrete atoms (or "spatial bins")

    p : ndarray, has shape (num_bins,)

        Probability mass of the first distribution on each atom.

    q : ndarray, has shape (num_bins,)

        Probability mass of the second distribution on each atom.

    Returns
    -------
    dist : float

        The Wasserstein distance between the two distributions.

    T : ndarray, has shape (num_bins, num_bins)

        Optimal transport plan. Satisfies p == T.sum(axis=0)
        and q == T.sum(axis=1).

    Note
    ----
    This function is meant for demo purposes only and is not
    optimized for speed. It should still work reasonably well
    for moderately sized problems.
